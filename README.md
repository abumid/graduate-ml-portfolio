# Applied ML & Product Portfolio

This repository is split into two parts:

- **`projects/`** — demonstrates my **programming fundamentals** and hands-on technical skills (clean code, algorithms, data handling, ML basics, experimentation).
- **`industry_projects/`** — demonstrates how I apply those fundamentals in **real-world, commercially successful projects**, working as a **Product Owner / CCO** (requirements → architecture decisions → delivery → measurable outcomes).

> Portfolio note: Some industry projects are shared as public-friendly case studies (no source code) due to confidentiality. Where possible, I provide demos, screenshots, and documentation links.

## Repository Structure

### 1) `projects/` — Fundamentals (technical depth)
This folder shows that I can:
- write and structure Python projects
- work with data (preprocessing, analysis, visualization)
- implement ML workflows (training/inference basics)
- validate results (testing, reproducibility mindset)
- explain decisions clearly (README-driven work)

**Goal:** prove I can build things myself and understand the core engineering/ML foundations.

---

### 2) `industry_projects/` — Applied Industry Work (commercial impact)
This folder shows how I use those fundamentals in production-like scenarios:
- designing workflows for real clients and constraints
- making architecture-level decisions with engineers
- validating ML behavior (edge cases, quality checks, false positives/negatives)
- shipping features that bring business value (adoption, efficiency, risk reduction)

**My typical role here:** Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) with Product Owner responsibilities.

## Quick links

- **Fundamentals:** see the `projects/` folder
- **Industry case studies:** see the `industry_projects/` folder

## How to navigate

1) Start with `projects/` if you want to evaluate **coding + ML fundamentals**  
2) Then open `industry_projects/` to see **how I turn fundamentals into business outcomes**

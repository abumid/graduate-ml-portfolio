# Project 2: Supervised Machine Learning Classification

## Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to a structured dataset, focusing on classification performance, model evaluation, and optimization.

Models implemented include Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, with systematic validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Workflow
The modeling pipeline follows a structured process:
- Objective definition
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model initialization and training
- Prediction and performance evaluation
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter optimization using randomized search
- Iterative refinement based on validation results

## Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-Validation
- Randomized Hyperparameter Search

## Repository Structure
- `notebook/` — Jupyter notebook with full implementation
- `data/` — dataset used for training and evaluation
- `assets/` — workflow and process diagrams

## Results
Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics and cross-validation, with iterative tuning applied to improve generalization performance.

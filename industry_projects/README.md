# Industry Projects (CCO / Technical Product Owner)

In these industry projects, my role was:

**Role:** Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) — owned product discovery/delivery as **Technical Product Owner** (requirements, architecture decisions, acceptance criteria), working with ML/Backend/Frontend teams.

**Role & contributions (my part)**
- Owned: problem framing, requirements, user flows, acceptance criteria, and delivery milestones  
- Made architecture trade-offs with engineers (ML/Backend/Frontend), balancing performance, UX, and deployment constraints  
- Used ML fundamentals to define thresholds, validate outputs, and handle edge cases  
- Worked closely with stakeholders to align product behavior with business risk and real-world constraints  

> Code ownership varies by project: some demos include public code, while production components are not shared due to confidentiality and NDA constraints.
